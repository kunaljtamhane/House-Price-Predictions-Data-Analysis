## Data Preprocessing
In the data preprocessing stage, we clean and transform the raw data to make it suitable for analysis and modeling. The main tasks include:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Scaling numerical features

## Data Visualization
Data visualization is crucial for understanding the patterns and relationships in the data. We use various visualization techniques to explore the data, such as:

Scatter plots
Histograms
Correlation heatmaps
Box plots

## Getting the Data Ready for Predictions
Before making predictions, the data needs to be prepared by:

-Splitting the data into training and testing sets
-Feature engineering to create new features
-Selecting the most relevant features for the model
